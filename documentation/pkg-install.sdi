[subsection [title Source compilation]]

[subsection [title Maven]]
[paragraph]
Regular releases are made to the
[link-ext [target "http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cio7m-r2"] Central Repository],
so it's possible to use the [term [type package] io7m-r2] package
in your projects with the following Maven dependencies:

[paragraph]
[verbatim [type example]
"<dependency>
  <groupId>com.io7m.r2</groupId>
  <artifactId>io7m-r2-main</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>"]

[paragraph]
All [link-ext [target "http://io7m.com"] io7m.com] packages use
Semantic Versioning [footnote-ref semver], which implies that it is
always safe to use version ranges with an exclusive upper bound equal
to the next major version - the API of the package will not change in
a backwards-incompatible manner before the next major version.
