 * <p>The type of batched instances.</p>
 *
 * <p>A batch consists of a set of one or more vertex buffers containing mesh
 * data, and a vertex buffer containing a set of transforms - one per rendered
 * object.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary use case for batched instances is rendering a lot of copies of
 * the same mesh in a single draw call.</p>
 *
 * <p>Batched instances may only use orthogonal transforms, to avoid having to
 * perform a costly matrix inversion on the GPU (to produce a per-instance
 * normal matrix).</p>
